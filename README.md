2. This project requires me to explore, analyze and evaluate how algorithms are being used in my field (Game Design) by examining the broader social, moral, and ethical implications of algorithm use in Game Design from both consumer and developer perspectives.

3. This project requires me to create a data visualization using data from City of Chicago's open data service. 
What I learn from this experiment:
Extract and clean data from a dataset (like Chicago’s community health values).
Visualize it dynamically using Chart.js, turning raw numbers into an easy-to-read bar chart.
Style data presentation with CSS gradients and transitions, showing how design can make statistics more engaging.
